The experience has been one that has highlighted how Open Source is changing programming for all of us. First up: the pleasures of open source ðŸ™‚

The goal of the app was to get something very basic and quick out there. I was taking a very simple utility â€“ one that had been built over a day and making it available to everyone. Doing this meant adding what is commonly expected of most apps these days: storing results in a database, adding support for accounts and authentication, and integrating with a couple of external systems to make the utility easier to use.

<!--more-->When building such apps â€“ it is really helpful to use libraries/frameworks and external tools. Doing this can help speed development significantly. The interesting part was just the how many such external projects were actually used. I added 65+ libraries (jars) and used 10+ tools. I feel like there were many points that just jumped up at me:

**Open Source is great for basic capabilities:** Most of the basic nuts and bolts of the app required capabilities that have been built for decades â€“ tools like Postgres, and frameworks like Hibernate helped immediately. But, yes â€“ there were a number of things that the app did differently â€“ and most of this â€˜innovativeâ€™ stuff was left to me to do.

**Open Source helped me not get locked in:** Deploying to the cloud with Google App Engine or Heroku was not hard. Yes, these are commercial services/tools, but using open source helped me not take on these dependencies one at a time. Open source really has become an approach to standardization without committees.

**Open Source helped me take advantage of the latest technologies:** Software development is rapidly evolving &#8211; with new client side technologies for [CSS](http://lesscss.org/), [browser-based MVC frameworks](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), client-server communication technologies like [WebSockets](http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/), server-side frameworks like [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org/), and just tools for [distributed version control](http://git-scm.com/). Between playing with these frameworks when I get the chance, to a serious evaluation for a new app &#8211; api&#8217;s to open source projects help in experimenting with new technologies easily.

I am curious &#8211; what&#8217;s your favorite part of Open Source?

Coming next week (as soon as I get a chance to write it down): the pains of working using Open Source.
