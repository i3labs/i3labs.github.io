The last year has been a fun ride. Since we open-sourced and started talking about the ideas behind Violet we have gotten some really helpful lessons on how some of the best Voice Apps have been built.

A major theme has been how commonly a state-machine was used for implementing one of a few 'user-experience design patterns'. This insight resulted in us defining a [conversation flow language](https://helloviolet.ai/docs/conversation-flow-design) (and adding support for it into Violet).<!--more-->

You can see highlights from the Conversation Flow Design in the talk we gave at the VOICE Summit this year (see [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/vineet-sinha/buil ding-great-voice-experiences) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14L08pg8aK8)). Special thanks to [Mitchell Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-harris-6b44b923/) at the [RAIN Agency](https://rain.agency/) for collaborating on these ideas.

We also dug deep into the implementation and developers side of things. We added support for Google Home and refined a lot of the rough edges with Violet. We presented a talk at Dreamforce this year (see [video](https://www.salesforce.com/video/3579625/)).

I am going to be sharing more of the lessons in the upcoming months.
