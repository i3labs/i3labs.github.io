Over the past few years I have had the fortune of writing papers, blogging both publicly and internally for the companies I have worked at, teaching, and even presenting at conferences. This blog is an attempt at pulling all that into a single place.

Oh, and part of the agenda is discussing best practices with various emerging technologies, innovation, and some of the open sourcing projects that I care about.<!--more-->

I am looking forward to hearing what you think about it.

Any entires on this site that are earlier than this post will be those that I have brought in from one of the other places where I have written before.
