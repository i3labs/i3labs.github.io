Over the past few years I have had the fortune of writing papers, blogging both publicly and internally for the companies I have worked at, teaching, and even presenting at conferences. This blog is an attempt at pulling all that knowledge into a single place.

Oh, and part of the agenda is also a home for open sourcing projects that I care about.

Looking forward to hearing what you think about it.

Any entires on this site that are earlier than this post will be those that I have brought in from something that I have written before.
