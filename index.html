      <p>AI is radically transforming businesses. The best part is that it reduces inefficiencies and allows us to double down on our strengths - whether it is our existing team, product, or customers.</p>
      <p>Most AI projects focus on organizing data and algorithms before prioritizing business results. Doing that is risky, and we do it <a href="#approach">differently</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="approach">Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We approach every project driven to make it succeed. Our experience with AI means we help make decisions so that business results can be gotten quickly, keeping a few things in mind:
    <ol>
      <li><b>AI as a Differentiator:</b> The fact that AI is considered cool is leading to most organizations wanting to adopt it. But, the largest opportunities with AI comes to those that that are able to question core businesses assumptions.</li>
      <li><b>Business ROI and Use-Case Aligned:</b> AI efforts don't need to focus on back-end considerations like LLM training and other data-engineering considerations. By starting with business needs and use-cases we often help speed organizational alignment and help both uncover and solve hidden problems.</li>
      <li><b>Value and Risk Aware Roadmapping:</b> Many Software projects plan to deliver value near the end of the effort. In contrast, we work with clients to find results that can be delivered before large restructuring efforts need to take place.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We work with origanization to identify what an AI transformation effort would look like for them. We look for opportunities for delivering 90% of the value with 10% of the effort.
