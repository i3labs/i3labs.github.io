    <p>It is clear that AI is radically transforming businesses. And on top of that we can be intentional to not only reduce inefficiencies but to help employees be more valuable and critical.</p>
    <p>See what 20+ years of experience building with AI can do. We help businesses side-step large projects and instead focus on getting quick results.</p>
    <p>Most AI projects focus on orgnaizing data and algorithms before prioritizing business results. Doing that is risky, and we do it differently.</p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We approach every project driven to make it succeed. Our experience with AI means we help make decisions so that business results can be gotten quickly, keeping a few things in mind:
    <ol>
      <li><b>AI as a Differentiator:</b> - The fact that AI is considered cool is leading to most organizations wanting to adopt it. But, the largest opportunity of AI rewards comes to those that that are able to question core businesses assumptions.</li>
      <li><b>Business ROI and Use-Case Aligned:</b> - AI efforts often focus on back-end considerations like LLM training and other data-engineering considerations. Instead we start with business needs and use-cases.</li>
      <li><b>Value and Risk Aware Roadmapping</b> - It is common for Software projects to deliver value near the end of the effort. In contrast, we work with clients to find results that can be delivered before large restructuring efforts need to take place.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We work with origanization to identify what an AI transformation effort would look like for them. We look for opportunities for delivering 90% of the value with 10% of the effort.

    <p>I started i3labs after noticing both the opportunity that computers bring as well as the challenges in making sure technologies meet users pains and help them with solutions.</p>

    <p>I love exploring technologies to make users' lives better. Beyond exploring these ideas while doing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at MIT CSAIL, I have also worked with Microsoft, Accenture Technology Labs, Motorola, Salesforce, and many startups.</p>
