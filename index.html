  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We approach every project driven to make it succeed. Our experience with AI means we help make decisions so that business results can be gotten quickly, keeping a few things in mind:
    <ol>
      <li><b>AI as a Differentiator:</b> - The fact that AI is considered cool is leading to most organizations wanting to adopt it. But, the largest opportunity of AI rewards comes to those that that are able to question core businesses assumptions.</li>
      <li><b>Business ROI and Use-Case Aligned:</b> - AI efforts often focus on back-end considerations like LLM training and other data-engineering considerations. Instead we start with business needs and use-cases.</li>
      <li><b>Value and Risk Aware Roadmapping</b> - It is common for Software projects to deliver value near the end of the effort. In contrast, we work with clients to find results that can be delivered before large restructuring efforts need to take place.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We work with origanization to identify what an AI transformation effort would look like for them. We look for opportunities for delivering 90% of the value with 10% of the effort.

  <p><b>Modern Voice Development:</b> <a href="https://helloviolet.ai/">Violet</a> focuses on increasing enterprise adoption of Voice Applications by building a framework that manages probabilities of matching intents with a simple HTML like language. Taking lessons from Web and Mobile UI development, Violet tries to help separate out Design from Business Logic.</p>

Helped define the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper">Caliper</a> standard for collection of data, and took the lead in the development of vendor neutral validation of data for integrating analytics across multiple tools.</p>

  <p><b>Productivity with Software Architecture</b>: Helping experienced developers with the 90% of time that they sepnd on figuring out code. Designed to help with large software projects by blending algorithms, common visual representations, and user interactions. <a href="https://www.architexa.com/">Architexa</a> was spun out from MIT, and included support for Class Diagramming, Layered Architectures, and Sequence Diagrams.

  <p><b>Navigation for Semistructured Data:</b> Developed techniques to allow users to explore and refine (faceted navigation) when given access to semistructured repositories.

    <p>I love exploring technologies to make users' lives better. I started i3labs after noticing both the opportunity that computers bring as well as the challenges in making sure technologies meet users pains and help them with solutions.</p>

    <p>Beyond exploring these ideas while doing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at MIT CSAIL, I have also worked with Microsoft, Accenture Technology Labs, Motorola, Salesforce, and many startups.</p>
