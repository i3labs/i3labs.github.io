## Emerging Tech

**Voice (Violet):** Project to ease enterprise adoption of Voice Applications.

**Augmented Reality:** Details coming

**Virtual Reality:** Details coming

## Education / Understanding

**Implicit:** Details coming

**Caliper Validation:** Played a role in the definition of Caliper - an education standard for collection of analytics data. Took the lead in the development of an approach for vendor neutral validation of data for integrating analytics across multiple tools.

**Magnet:** A general purpose tool that offers users helpful navigation and refinement options for seeking information in these semistructured repositories.

## Software Architecture

**Relo:** Project trying to help developers understand the details of their software projects.  Originally inspired by informal developer drawings when being asked to explain code to coworkers, Relo was also influenced by the MFC Class Hierarchy Diagram, and worked hard at not overwhelming developers with their entire codebase.

**Strata:** An attempt at helping developers get a high-level view of their software projects.  Strata was designed with a number of algorithms to generate Layered Architectural Diagrams within seconds. It allowed users to quickly modify diagrams by dragging and dropping items into correct positions and thereby informing the algorithms.

**Architexa:** A code understanding and diagramming platform built to include Relo, Strata, and sequence diagram support. Architexa was spun out from MIT and bootstrapped to a company with 10-employees.
