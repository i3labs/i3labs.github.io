    <p>AI has the power to radically transform businesses - to not only reduce waste but to help existing employees drive more value and play a critical role for any organization.</p>
    <p> With 20+ years experience in this space we are helping businesses side-step large projects and instead get quick results.</p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We approach every project driven to make it succeed. Our 20+ years experience with AI means we help make decisions so that business results can be gotten quickly, keeping a few things in mind:
    <ol>
      <li><b>AI as a Differentiator:</b> - The fact that AI is considered cool is leading to most organizations wanting to adopt it. But, the largest opportunity of AI rewards comes to those that that are able to question core businesses assumptions.</li>
      <li><b>Business ROI and Use-Case Aligned:</b> - AI efforts often focus on back-end considerations like LLM training and other data-engineering considerations. Instead we start with business needs and use-cases.</li>
      <li><b>Value and Risk Aware Roadmapping</b> - It is common for Software projects to deliver value near the end of the effort. In contrast, we work with clients to find results that can be delivered before large restructuring efforts need to take place.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We work with origanizations to identify what an AI transformation effort would look like for them. We look for opportunities for delivering 90% of the value with 10% of the effort.
